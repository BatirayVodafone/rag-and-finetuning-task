# DS/MLE Candidate Take-Home Assessment

This repository contains the take-home assessment tasks for Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer candidates.

## Tasks Overview

The assessment consists of two distinct tasks, designed to evaluate a range of advanced skills in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

1.  **Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
    *   **Description:** Implement and evaluate a RAG system using hierarchical chunking, an on-disk vector database, and a small language model, focusing on resource-constrained environments.
    *   **Location:** [`rag/rag-task.md`](./rag/rag-task.md)

2.  **LLM Finetuning (PEFT Comparison)**
    *   **Description:** Finetune a small language model using two different Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, comparing their performance, resource consumption, and discussing potential generalization.
    *   **Location:** [`finetuning/finetuning-task.md`](./finetuning/finetuning-task.md)
